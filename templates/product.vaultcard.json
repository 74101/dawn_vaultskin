However, in practice, this approach is susceptible to flaws.<\/p><p><strong>This is due to the way that electromagnetic waves propagate through space.<\/strong><\/p><p>To ensure full protection, your cards need to be fully wrapped in metal foil with no gaps or spaces. This is almost impossible to achieve. A typical wallet with metal shielding can only protect against low-power reading devices, and only at certain angles.<\/p>",
